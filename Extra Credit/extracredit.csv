As she was laying on the floor, everyone around me immediately jumped into action. 

The guy who had just been sitting across from me jumped up, hit the emergency button, and repeatedly said,  ‚Äúwe‚Äôre having a medical emergency.‚Äù 

A couple people next to the woman secured her bags and the person beside the woman held her head from the floor. Another woman immediately got on the phone with 911. 

The woman came too and seemed to realize what had happened to her. She was apologetic and we immediately told her this was way more important than our commute. 

She decided to get off at DuPont and a couple people helped with her bags and even walked her to a bench. 

We went from strangers on our phones to a small community helping out our commuter buddy. It was beautiful. 

Welp, back to lurking on Reddit.

EDIT # 1: the stories that I‚Äôve read of people helping others, giving assistance, or wishing someone had helped them have touched me and others. I hope we continue to share things like this in this subreddit. I‚Äôve read every single reply and here‚Äôs what I know...there is kindness and we are not alone.

I'm only asking $5 per drive (although I'll happy to accept additional tips and/or cigarettes). I'll update tomorrow with a number and a little bit more info. Stay safe tomorrow folks!

Edit: holy christ I picked the wrong week to quit drinking. All right, There's like 2 feet feet of snow on the ground so after I dig my truck back out of the snow, I'll figure out how to handle the logistics of getting these tacos where they need to go 

EDIT: OK EVERYBODYYYYY IM GOING TO GO TO TACO BELL AND literally, I am going to clean out the place for all the tacos they have. I'm going to the Hyattsville taco bell first and I'm literally going to buy every taco I canm and I guess afterwards I'll open up to PMs, starting with college park I guess. PEACE

edit: OK I'm re upping on tacos in about 1 hour at the one on 14th street. If you're downtown, PM me now so I don't end up with 500 extra tacos tonight ",2014-02-13 05:29:25

Every day Stanley Eubanks sat on the corner of E St SW and 3rd St SW right across from NASA HQ. He was a friendly man, always saying hello to passersby. He knew our names and listened to us talk about our lives. In return we learned about his. The local dogs loved him so much their owners would get frustrated by their insistence on greeting him.

Stan spent last winter making sure he could find the hypothermia van so he wouldn't freeze on the streets. This past year he finally found housing and was excited to not have spend the night outside in the cold. He also found a part time job and was so proud to be bringing in money of his own. Then he had knee surgery to help with chronic joint pain. He slipped in his kitchen post surgery and shattered his leg. Over the course of the next six months doctors passed him around telling him he'd need surgery or amputation or nerve blocks. He lost his job and was in danger of losing his housing. All the while his heart was failing because of the damaged, unhealed leg. Last week he told me the doctors told him he was out of options. He had grown so weak surgery would kill him. I hadn't seen him the last few work days and feared the worst. Today I learned he had passed. 

Stan had a storied history and was far from a perfect man. He grew up in poverty and abuse. He spent time in prison and was estranged from most of his family. He was a man working hard to escape poverty and gain stability. For all his faults and hardhip he was always cheerful and kind to us. I for one will miss him.",2018-12-12 01:58:33

"Welcome to DC, new folks. Now here's the 411.",726,3apnpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/3apnpk/welcome_to_dc_new_folks_now_heres_the_411/,318,1435011105.0,726,0,,"/r/washingtondc has been getting a ton of posts lately for people moving to dc and having really unrealistic expectations in finding a place to live. So, to hopefully stem the tide, here's some pointers before posting your situation:

1. Accept that DC is an expensive place to live.  Like Captain Spiers said, once you accept you're already dead, you can function like a soldier. Same thing goes with renting in DC. I don't care where you're coming from. If it's not SF or NY (in this country), chances are you are going to experience sticker shock. Get over it. DC metro area is generally the third most expensive market to live in outside of SF/NY. The market does not care what your projected budget is so you will either have to increase your budget or get used to alternative living arrangements that you may not be used to.

2. Use the sidebar. The tourist guide, the tenant survival guide, /r/DCforRent are all useful. Also use the search function. You are not the first person to be moving to DC.

3. DC has become a dynamic and lively place to live. You're no longer restricted to parts of Capitol Hill and NW to live in. The population of DC has grown 100k in the last ten years. You new folks are part of that explosion growth. And because of such, everyone is willing to live everywhere now. Including east of the Anacostia river.

4. Your best possible situation is if you are moving here with a roommate or SO already and you're both working.

5. If you are moving here by yourself with no resources, start looking at either sublets, roommates needed situations or biggest of all, the group house. Especially if you have a budget less than $1000/month.

6. Understand and factor in commuting time and costs into your decision where to live. It's a trade off: you pay more to live in DC because you have easy access to all that it offers. Most people don't even need a car in the District and if you do need one, there is Car2Go, Lyft, Uber, Zipcar, blah blah blah.

7. Also understand our Metro system is OK but it can suck big time. Especially on the weekends. So if you are on the fence about living in MD but will have ""easy access"" into DC via the Red line, think again.

8. If you're moving here with a car, do yourself a favor and register it in DC. Parking Enforcement is probably the most efficient department in all of DC government and your out of state plate will not save you from tickets, ESPECIALLY if you are parking on the streets. Also take careful note where you're parking and read the signs. Don't cry to us when you get that $100 courtesy tow ticket. Deal with it and also take that into consideration when looking for place to live. If you want to move to Adams Morgan or Dupont with a car but don't want to pay the $250/mo parking spot? Good luck. If you're living in Brookland, not really a problem.

9. There is crime here. It's a city so it's inherent. But it is nowhere near as bad as it was during the 80s/90s or even early aughts. When you read on neighborhood blogs about people complaining about pop-ups or someone painting their back deck bright colors, I think DC is gonna be alright.

10. Lastly, stand on the goddamn right, walk on the fucking left.

Welcome to the District!",2015-06-22 18:11:45

Half an hour back, I was travelling from Baltimore to here after the weekend. As the train stopped at the Union Station, I started move towards the door. There was a lady with a couple of bags sitting near the seat close to the exit doors asked ""What station is this"" and the guy near her, also moving to the towards the exit, replied ""DC"". As soon as I heard it, I felt so elated, it felt home. As I finish my program in 2 months I don't know what the future holds for me but I do know that I will always love this city and it will never cease being a home to me, at least in my heart.

Long shot -- to the guy who stood up to Metro bully-bum,701,967pci,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/967pci/long_shot_to_the_guy_who_stood_up_to_metro/,134,1533942256.0,701,0,benditlikebecca92,"Hi. Doubt you'll see this but thought I'd write anyway. I was on a Red Line train with you earlier this week during the evening commute. I was a couple seats away and you were standing. I saw the bummy-looking guy slouched over taking up the whole seat, saw him wake up and smack you in the upper arm and start yelling at you for ""standing too close"".

I don't know how many times I've seen people acting badly on metro, or intimidating others with their bodies, taking up space, yelling, listening to music too loud, etc. It's always upsetting and annoying.

I was so glad you faced up to the guy, and was surprised too. You seemed like a very typical metro commuter -- business casual, older, glasses, minding your own business and looking at your phone.  So when you turned around, got in the guy's face, took off your glasses and asked him if he wanted to start something, I was rooting you on. I don't like violence -- but I hate bullies, especially on metro, where there's nowhere to go to get away and people seem to meekly accept this kind of behavior.

You cowed the guy back into his seat. Then called the conductor. Then had him taken off the train and you talked to the cops. Good for you. I know people around me were annoyed to be delayed and I heard one woman tell you you should drop it and leave well enough alone. But I was so much happier when the guy was off the train -- he was threatening and weird and obviously had no problem assaulting a complete stranger.

So good for you, Metro stranger. I was happy to see someone stand up for themselves!",2018-08-10 19:04:16

A lot of places offering shutdown deals right now won't let you take the food to go because they expect you to order at least a drink or an appetizer. And to leave a tip! And screaming at the staff and making a huge scene to ""just put it in a box because I am furloughed"" is not the way to go about anything in life.

In my entire time driving in Belgium (5 year) I've seen maybe 2 people texting and driving. Today I saw dozens of people doing it. On the fucking highway. A guy nearly hit my car while texting...I saw several people speeding on the fucking emergency lane, people not giving a shit about full white lines. Also, people here not know what turn signals are? I saw several people cutting people off with barely any space without even using their turn signal.

And holy fuck, a truck nearly hit me when switching lanes as I was next to him. Most scared I've been on the road like ever, he got so close.

Of all the states I've been (and I've been to Ohio) this has been my worst experience on the road by far. I saw a cop just chilling in his lane as a guy sped past him in the emergency lane in a beat up car. 

Why is it so bad here? Do you guys just not give a fuck? Why do so many people text and drive here? I swear, in Europe, it's soo uncommon. You get your license taken if they catch you doing that shit. 

Just had to rant about this. I was constantly raging at all these fucking morons on the road and I needed a release. :P 

Anyway, thanks hearing me out. Or if you're one of the aforementioned drivers - screw you!",2018-02-27 23:41:33

After the drive up, my dad and I go get dinner at a bar in Stowe. While he‚Äôs parking, I go inside and order beers for us. I present the bartender with my DC driver‚Äôs license, and she looks at it skeptically. 

This sometimes happens in Vermont because they mostly see people from New England. I have the new DC ID, which includes the holographic thingamajig in the corner. I assure her that that‚Äôs the most legit ID out there, it‚Äôs probably very difficult to create a fake one. 

Bartender: Do you have a passport or something?

Me: Why?

Bartender: I can‚Äôt accept an ID from another country.

Me: Another country?

Bartender: Yeah, the District of Colombia. Isn‚Äôt that in the Caribbean or something.

Me: (Getting mad) That‚Äôs the capital. Of the United. States. Of. America.

Bartender: (getting mad cause she realizes she just made up a country) Well, you don‚Äôt have to get mad. I‚Äôm just doing my job. 

Then she asked who the other beer was for and I said my father, who is also from the great country of DC. 

Important to note that I love Vermont to death, but DC actually has more people than the whole state of VT. 

Edit: I‚Äôd be less pissed about it if we had the representation, but we don‚Äôt have the representation, so can I at least have the beer?",2019-03-03 05:37:40

This is so neat, I wonder what all these helicopters are?"" or maybe you've been here a while and are thinking ""shut up you stupid helicopters! Fwop fwop fwop, I get it, you can hover, big deal!"" but are still curious as to what these helicopters are. Well, I've put together a handy-dandy guide of helicopters and VTOL aircraft that I've seen zipping around.

**Presidential Helicopters and VTOL**

Now, Marine One is any helicopter that the POTUS is in but there is one iconic helicopter associated with the name, the [Sikorsky VH-3D Sea King](https://i.imgur.com/Sqfdt1P.jpg). This big guy is commonly seen circling the city usually accompanied by one or two [VH-60N White Hawks](https://i.imgur.com/YGmsKwd.jpg). Occasionally you may see these making a landing at the White House or Naval Observatory.

The VH-3D is going to be replaced by 2020 by the [VH-92A](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/marine-one-upgrade-next-presidential-helicopter-fleet-getting-closer-to-debut.html)

Much more rare is the [MV-22B](https://i.imgur.com/llv1Ylp.jpg), a VTOL aircraft operated by HMX-1

**Military**

The military also has specially marked helicopters for VIP transport. The US Army's 12th aviation battalion has a presence here with several helicopters. Most recognizably is the [VH-60N ""Gold Top""](https://puu.sh/AMpCz/b8c9d71e46.jpg). the Army also maintains conventional [UH-60 Black Hawks](https://i.imgur.com/wDeLmuv.png) (often seen with the external fuel tanks as pictured) and the much smaller [UH-72A Lakota](https://i.imgur.com/YzMGUiG.jpg).

Not to be outdone, the Air Force also has a presence here with the USAF 1st helicopter squadron. This squadron is made up of specially painted [UH-1N Hueys](https://puu.sh/AMpOl/28482a9b39.jpg). These can typically be seen flying back and forth along the Potomac River.

Last but certainly not least is the [United States Coast Guard Eurocopter HH-65D Dolphin](https://i.imgur.com/BCRszHh.jpg). This strikingly orange helicopter can be seen traversing up and down the rivers. 

**Police and EMS**

The US Park Police have two [Bell 412 helicopters](https://i.imgur.com/0V3kw0n.jpg) that they use for law enforcement, search and rescue and medevac in the DC area. These can typically be seen near the river and National Parklands.

The Metropolitan Police Department also has two helicopters, Eurocopter AS350B3, pictured [here](https://i.imgur.com/V2HTkBw.jpg) and [here](https://i.imgur.com/20j0btS.jpg). Non-residents may recognize this helicopter from the movie Spiderman: Homecoming. They do police stuff and are mostly nocturnal.

Maryland State Police operates a rather large [Agusta Westland AW-139](https://i.imgur.com/gdfwt27.jpg) that can sometimes be seen in the region.

MedStar has it's own helicopter used for patient transfers and medevac flights, this life saver is distinguishable by its [bright yellow color](https://puu.sh/AMqnR/58f1ba7c57.jpg). This is an Eurocopter EC-135.

Much rarer is [INOVA Fairfax's helicopter](https://i.imgur.com/8gnmyuZ.jpg) which is operated by PHI Air Medical.

Our FCC comment was filed because of what you did. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!**

Here is [the photo of reddit's comment with the FCC stamp on it](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2aspjb/today_with_just_a_few_hours_notice_over_a_dozen/).

More [photos of the impromptu reddit meetup](http://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/2astxe/managed_to_grab_a_few_photos_of_all_the_redditors/) in front of the FCC building!

----------

We need you to help us hand-deliver our official FCC comment so it can be considered in the initial comment period. Here is [the blogpost about it](http://www.redditblog.com/2014/07/join-us-reddit-is-filling-fcc-comment.html).

We don't have any reddit employees close enough to deliver them, so we need your help again.

This is what you need to do to successfully hand deliver reddit's comment:

1. Print out 2 copies of [our official FCC comment with the cover letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GT1QZq1QrXfBt4NZQIjqzlO7NA-xwcleODENIVM7ZzQ/edit) right here.
2. Take the documents (without an envelope) to [this address in Washington, D.C.](http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/electronic-and-hard-copy-filing-address)
3. Arrive there at today at 3:15 p.m. ET
4. Be an internet hero!

Just please remember:

* be polite
* no envelopes (seriously)
* please take photos & videos‚Äîwe'll feature them on the reddit blog
* you will be going through security
* the FCC building is about 3 blocks from the Smithsonian metro station
* the [likely meeting place is right here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Potomac+Center+Cf+LLC/@38.88394,-77.028099,3a,75y,255.84h,74.2t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s-4AVAziZvySv76X594tmqw!2e0!4m7!1m4!3m3!1s0x89b7b775dd015009:0x98c13836a73fbbce!2s445+12th+St+SW,+Washington,+DC+20024!3b1!3m1!1s0x0:0x32dbab57001e635c) next to the FCC building.

**very important**: you must have two copies of our FCC comment when delivering it.

It would be wonderful if we could have a group of redditors make the trip so we can also drive the idea that people are using sneakernet to help protect the open internet.  :D

Let me know if you can do this and I'll get in touch with you.  If possible, there will also be a group of advocacy groups also submitting documents to the FCC as well.


Thank you in advance!
