Hello Everyone! I'm Israel and I'm excited to learn alongside you all this semester! I work as a credit risk analyst at Freddie Mac. My role requires working with large datasets and my hope it through this course and program, I will get better equipped with the tools/technologies and processes to drive efficient, reliable and value added analysis (not just this role but anywhere i may end up). I was an accounting major at mason and this my second semester in the DAE program. I am taking OR 531 this semester as well. I am familiar with SQL and reporting tools (mainly tableau and MicroStrategy). I have a basic understanding of R and python from prior coursework. I hope to become highly proficient in SQL and python by the end of this program in addition to building a sold statistics foundation. I hope you all have a great semeseter!
