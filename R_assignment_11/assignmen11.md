the first visualization in this link shows 100 top tweeters. I thought first that it was a bad choice to pick a pie chat for that. the colors and slices are too much for to derive anything meaningful out of it. Second, i dont see the need to list out all 100 names. to project useful information, i would keep it simple by displaying top 5 or top 10 people with a bar chart.

this visualizaton manipulates the y-axis to get across a political opinion. I would assume the authors of this visualization are anti-welfare programs are unfairly projecting the idea that welfare recipients are much underrepresented in full time workers. But in reality welfarre recipients are higher by 7 million but the graph makes it seem like they are atleast 4 times higher. I would correct the bar graph to show the correct scale for comparison.
